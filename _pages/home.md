The [Northeastern University at Qinhuangdao](https://www.neuq.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"} Language and Intelligent Systems (**NEUQ LIS**) group is engaged in research within the field of natural language processing, embodied intelligence, and computer vision, among others.
We create innovative algorithms and devise fresh frameworks to address complex challenges in NLP, leveraging techniques such as deep learning and reinforcement learning. 

Our mission is to push the frontiers of artificial intelligence, simultaneously facilitating significant advancements in practical text processing applications with wide-ranging implications for real-world issues.
