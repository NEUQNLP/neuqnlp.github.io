# Open positions

**Quota and Recruitment Process**

Our group is primarily seeking undergraduate students for research internships at NEUQ. We also welcome collaborations with other universities or institutions. Every year around March, we conduct a large-scale recruitment activity for NEUQ undergraduates. If you're interested in joining us through this channel, you don't need to send your resume. We will have relevant admission procedures in place.

**Contact Information and Application Process**

If you're interested in joining us, please feel free to contact us via email. Please attach your resume to the email. We will review emails once or twice a week and strive to respond to each email. If you don't receive a response within 10 days, it's possible that your email was missed. Please don't hesitate to reach out again. We apologize if our response time is slow.

**Expectations and Requirements**

We hope that you possess strong self-motivation, learning ability, and are willing to dedicate extra time to laboratory research activities for an extended period.

We are looking for students with a strong foundation in mathematics and a deep understanding of deep learning. It's essential to have trained common models by yourself and be willing to engage in relevant research during the scientific research internship, supplemented by experiments. Alternatively, you should have excellent programming skills, have done research related to deep learning, and be willing to explore the essence based on experiments during the scientific research internship, supplemented by theory.

**Priority Considerations**

We will give priority to students with relevant experience, including but not limited to:

* Students with experience in scientific research projects, especially those who have published papers.
* Students who have won awards in related competitions such as informatics, mathematics, physics, etc.
* Students who have taken relevant courses and achieved excellent results, such as optimization theory, machine learning theory, deep learning, etc.

If you're interested in joining us, please send your resume to <ins>pbr52588@gmail.com</ins>. We look forward to working with you.
